	<h1>Hi there, I'm Nhat Le!</h1>

  <p> I am currently a Senior Biomedical Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.pathai.com/">PathAI</a> </p>
	<p>Before joining PathAI, I obtained a PhD in Neuroscience and Statistics from the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, working at the lab of Prof. Mriganka Sur. My PhD <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/147479">thesis</a> explores the neural circuits that underlie value-guided decision making. </p>
  
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, brewing coffee, listening to classical music and going on long walks.</p>
